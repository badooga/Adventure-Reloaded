# Adventure Reloaded
This is a Quilt modpack that focuses on adventuring, combat, and mobs. It also includes Xaero's map mods, a few building mods, and some quality of life additions.

## Features
This mod includes a variety of features that make adventuring in Minecraft fun. The lists below detail some of these features, but are not exhaustive.

<details>
<summary>Mobs</summary>
Think you can handle some challenge? This pack adds:

- Upgrades and new abilities for a variety of vanilla mobs
- Revamps for the ender dragon and wither bosses
- New mobs and bosses to fight, ranging from the copper golem to a fearsome night lich
</details>

<details>
<summary>Combat</summary>
While the mobs have been upgraded, so have you. You gain the following features:

- Certain items can be stacked more - e.g. potions can stack to 3
- Allied mobs like pets and babies won't be hit by your attacks accidentally
- A simple dodge roll that lets you evade attacks
- If brought to 0 HP, a friend can revive you before you die
- When you die, a grave is left behind with all of your stuff
</details>

<details>
<summary>Loot</summary>
What good is adventuring if you don't get anything out of it? Here's some of the new loot:

- Extra pottery sherds to dig up from lost ruins
- Netherite nuggets sometimes dropped by fearsome piglin brutes
- Mysterious eyes found across the world that must be gathered in order to enter the End
- New, forgotten plants that can only be dug up by the sniffer
</details>

<details>
<summary>Exploration</summary>
While this pack doesn't change terrain generation, it does add a few extra things to the world:

- Boss lairs scattered across the landscape
- A new cave biome filled with ancient plants lost to time
- A minimap and world map to help keep track of your journeys
- A way to set checkpoints in the outer end (check your advancements to learn more!)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Downtime</summary>
When you want a break from adventuring, you can now enjoy:

- Copper hopper upgrades and pipes that let you transport and sort items into containers
- New variants of grass, stone, nether bricks, and other blocks to decorate your base with
- Additional music discs to jam to!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Quality of Life</summary>
To help streamline your experience, you now have:

- A button that lets you sort your inventory
- The ability to apply armor trims to your tools
- Improved anvils and enchanting tables that make enchanting less of a pain
- New blocks that let you barter/trade with multiple piglins/villagers at once
</details>

## Compatibility
While it is stable and playable, **this modpack isn't really intended to be used on its own** - it's designed to be combined with other mods/modpacks that enhance other aspects of the game.

<details>
<summary>Client Enhancements</summary>
I recommend using the [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive/) modpack, which is an open source Optifine alternative. I'm also working on a Client Enhancements modpack that compliments Additive by adding a few extra features to the client.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Server Utilities</summary>
It's always good to optimize your server's performance, but if you're a server admin, you might also want some extra tools to help manage your world. If you want both, check out my [Quilt Server Utilities](https://modrinth.com/modpack/quilt-server-utilities) modpack.
</details>

<details>
<summary>World Generation</summary>
What good is adventuring if there aren't any new structures or biomes to explore? With so many different options out there, I left them out of the modpack so that it can be compatible with whatever you decide to put together.

I'm currently putting together a companion modpack for worldgen, but in the meantime, I recommend using [Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tectonic) and the [Stardust Labs](https://modrinth.com/user/Stardust) projects for world generation, and [Dungeons and Taverns](https://modrinth.com/datapack/dungeons-and-taverns), [Hopo's](https://modrinth.com/user/Ohponopono) structure series, and [YUNGNICKYOUNG's](https://modrinth.com/user/YUNGNICKYOUNG) various overhauls for structures.
